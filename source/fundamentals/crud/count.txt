If we just want to know how many documents match a query we can
perform a the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.count_documents`` method operation
instead of a full query. We can get a count of all of the documents
in a collection:

.. code-block:: python

   >> posts.count_documents({})
   3

or just of those documents that match a specific query:

.. code-block:: python

   >> posts.count_documents({"author": "Mike"})
   2
