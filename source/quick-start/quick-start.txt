Quick Start
===========

.. code-block:: python

  from pymongo import MongoClient

  client = MongoClient()
  client.drop_database("test-database")

This tutorial is intended as an introduction to working with
**MongoDB** and **PyMongo**.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before we start, make sure that you have the **PyMongo** distribution
installed. In the Python shell, the following
should run without raising an exception:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import pymongo

This tutorial also assumes that a MongoDB instance is running on the
default host and port. Assuming you have `downloaded and installed
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/>`_ MongoDB, you
can start it like so:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mongod
